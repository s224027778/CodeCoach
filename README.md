Tutor booking application
Our application is developed in a competent and effective environment by utilizing Android Studio and SQLite. The combination of SQLite's lightweight data storage capabilities and Android Studio's extensive development tools allows for a streamlined development process, resulting in an application that is both user-friendly and performant.
Our primary objectives include: 
	Provide a secure login and signup experience for different user types.
	Allow students to view detailed tutor profiles, including expertise and reviews - The app will enable students to easily connect with available tutors
	Display tutor locations to assist students in finding nearby tutors - Students can search for tutors within a certain radius of their current location, making it easier to locate and connect with tutors who are geographically convenient.
	Support booking requests and confirmations between students and tutors – Students and tutors have options to work around their schedules. 
	Implement a review system to gather feedback from students about tutor sessions – Students can leave reviews about their sessions. 
	Enhance communication between students and tutors via in-app messaging.
	Notify both tutors and students about booking requests, and confirmations.
